# Ambiance
Ambiance uses Google Maps to help you remember places that you want to checkout or favorite spots that might accidentally slip your mind. Our experiences are what makes us. Find yourself where you want to be. 

This web app was created using Spring, Hibernate, MySQL, Bootstrap, and Google Maps API.

## Getting Started

To get started. Register an account. Then navigate to the Search Map and search a place you would like to save. The app will step you through creating and adding tags to this place. Tags will help you filter your places when you are trying to decide where you want to go. Example tags might be: “Date Night”, “Tacos”, “Cheap”, or “Great Beer”. You can select multiple tags on your dashboard to filter your places to find the perfect one. 

If you are looking to check out somewhere new, then navigate to “The Latest News”. There you will find up to date articles on restaurants, beer, and wine.  

### Prerequisites

To run this code you will need your own Google Maps key.
